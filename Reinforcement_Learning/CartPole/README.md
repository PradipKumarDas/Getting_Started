# CartPole with OpenAI Gym, Ray Tune and RLLib

https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/

The objective of this program is to keep a pole upright. Specifically, the pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum starts upright, and the goal is to prevent it from falling over by increasing and reducing the cart's velocity.

This program uses OpenAI Gym that provides a varity of environments including CartPole environment that is used in this program.

Ray Tune and RLlib are also used to train agent that moves the cart to balance the pole on the cart and later to fine tune the training to make the agent perform better.

Videos are also available in the GitHub repository to view the environment and the agent, and to realize how the agent interactions with the environment before and after its training.
